			<p>Did you know that Kellijane has a Wedding and Gift Registry Service?  Couples (straight or gay…or anyone who wants to make a wish list for themselves) can select bedding, towels, table linens, and even gifts for their wedding party.</p>
			<p>Although most registries focus on china, glass, silver, and kitchen appliances only, these special events are unique opportunities to get luxury items that many couples would not think of buying for themselves. Friends and family will know that their gifts are special when they give heirloom quality sheets, handmade blankets, exquisite linen tablecloths and napkins, or luscious towels that soak up every drop of water.</p>
			<p>Kellijane also carries items that are perfect for wedding ceremonies, including travel pillows embroidered with each member of the wedding party’s name along with “Friends Are Forever,” and a white suede Ring Bearer pillow embellished with a white satin ribbon as well as the happy couple’s names and the date of the nuptials.</p>
			<p>Please call 215-790-0233 or email <a href="mailto:info@kellijane.com">info@kellijane.com</a> to sign up today!</p>
